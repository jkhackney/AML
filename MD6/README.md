Directory structure:
  data
  notebooks
  project
  
The images in the data directory have already been processed using the libraries mentioned in the comments. That part of the notebook is not included here.

To run the notebook you will need all of the files in the directories (images)

You will also need to install the holistic network edge detection model from Xie in the notebooks/hed/ directory, or else access its github repository:
  The Caffe model is encoded into two files that you need to copy to notebooks/hed/ or else link to online
  1. Proto text file: https://github.com/s9xie/hed/blob/master/examples/hed/deploy.prototxt
  2. Pretrained caffe model: http://vcl.ucsd.edu/hed/hed_pretrained_bsds.caffemodel
