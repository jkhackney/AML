# CAS Advanced Machine Learning Computer Vision Project (Module 6) Jeremy Hackney 3/2023

### Jupyter notebook
"Copy_of_CV_Project03" will run on Colab if you copy the necessary data files to your Google Drive (see below)

### Keep the directory and subdirectory structure when you copy the notebook:

  - data
  
  - notebooks
  
  - project
  
### Image pre-processing not included
The images in the data directory have already been processed using the libraries and methods mentioned in the comments. That part of the notebook is not included here. To run the notebook on other datasets, you'll need to process your own data.

### You will also need to install the holistic network edge detection model from Xie in the notebooks/hed/ directory, or else access its github repository:

  - The Caffe model is encoded into two files that you need to copy to notebooks/hed/ or else link to online
  
  - 1. Proto text file: (https://github.com/s9xie/hed/blob/master/examples/hed/deploy.prototxt)
  
  - 2. Pretrained caffe model: (http://vcl.ucsd.edu/hed/hed_pretrained_bsds.caffemodel)
