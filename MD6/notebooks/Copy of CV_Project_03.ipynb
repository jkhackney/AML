mm\n","<br><br>\n","\n","- Detecting edges first, then thresholding, then segmenting with \"connected components\" relies on a good thresholding filter\n","- The HED model is sensitive to the contrast in the input image\n","- The combination of HED/connected components found a high number of very small crystals -- at least the edge detection identified them as small (thick edge boundaries took away pixels)\n","- The microbiology-trained cellpose model finds fewer very small shapes but more individual segments\n","- The labelling in cellpose is different in each image and could be tracked with a bit more work\n","- However aggregating the cellpose results across images is not straightforward, so you choose the best one <br><br>\n","\n","- Both methods harvested many many more crystals with less work than by hand\n","- It's likely that both ML methods overlooked the darkest crystals, which happen to be of highest importance\n","- It's likely that the human method over-sampled the dark crystals, because they're the most important!\n","- The ML methods however both found a lower average polar angle which is statistically significantly different from the expected random distribution\n","- The human method found a larger polar angle which was not distinguishable from random\n","- This result is due to the sampling of the crystals <br><br>\n","\n","- Matching path differences from the color chart in the difference algorithm works for pixels chosen from the chart, but does it really match the sample images well?\n","- The yellows in the data seem to match the yellows in the color chart beyond 750 nm but *there is no blue at all* in the sample so the yellows in the sample are actually bronze and to the left of the blue band in the color chart (smaller path difference) which is how I identified them in 1993 as well.\n","- Not limiting the Michel-Levy search to order 1 increases variance as some matches fit higher orders\n","- Samples thicker than order 1 will cause difficulty with this method (using average pixel values in a ROI cannot discern order) \n","- Some versions of the Michel-Levy chart show brighter yellows in the smaller path differences ... a matter of (human) judgment\n","- Using the same CCD/software to calibrate a digital interference chart and record the sample's colors would help
